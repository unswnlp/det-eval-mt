"Item 1 Dear Parents and Carers, As we strive to ensure the safety and well-being of all students during drop-off and pick-up times, we kindly remind all parents to park in designated legal spots when visiting the school.

By parking in designated areas, you help maintain a safe and efficient flow of traffic during busy school hours. We appreciate your cooperation in adhering to parking regulations and prioritising the safety of our school community. Let's work together to create a safe and stress-free environment for all students and families during drop-off and pick-up times. Thank you for your attention to this important matter. Warm regards, "
"Item 2 Dear Parents/Guardians, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that during a routine inspection, nits (lice eggs) have been detected in our classroom. While the presence of nits does not necessarily indicate an infestation, it is important to take proactive measures to prevent the spread of lice among students. As a precautionary measure, I kindly ask that you check your child's hair for nits and lice. If nits or lice are found, please follow the recommended treatment and prevention guidelines provided by health authorities. It is essential to notify the school if your child has lice so that we can take appropriate steps to prevent further spread. To prevent the spread of lice, please remind your child not to share hats, hair accessories, combs, or brushes with their classmates. Regularly washing and drying hats, bed linens, and clothing in hot water can also help eliminate lice and nits. The health and well-being of our students are our top priority, and we appreciate your cooperation in addressing this issue promptly. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me or the school nurse. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, "

"Item 4 Subject: Concerns About Your Child's School Attendance Dear [Parent's Name], I hope you are well. I am writing to talk about how often your child is coming to school. I have noticed that your child has been missing school a lot, and this can make it hard for them to learn and do well in their classes. Going to school every day is really important for your child.

I know there might be reasons why your child is missing school, and I am here to help you figure out how we can help them come to school more often. If there are any problems or things that are making it hard for your child to come to school, please let me know so we can work together to find ways to make it easier for them.

"Item 10 Dear Parents and Students, I trust this message finds you well. As part of our commitment to delivering quality education in line with the NSW Department of Education curriculum, I would like to remind Year 9 students of the upcoming English assessment focusing on character development in the literary text, ""The Merchant of Venice."" This assessment is designed to align with the NSW English curriculum standards, specifically targeting the development of students' analytical skills and comprehension of characterisation within the text. By exploring the character progression of significant individuals such as Shylock, Antonio, Portia, and Bassanio, students will engage with key themes and textual features outlined in the NSW curriculum guidelines. It is important to note that this assessment is worth 30% of the yearly mark for English. Therefore, it is crucial for students to dedicate sufficient time and effort to this task to ensure their success. Parents, your role in supporting students to prepare for this assessment is vital in reinforcing the learning objectives set by the NSW Department of Education. Encouraging students to delve into character complexities and thematic elements contributes to their literacy development and academic growth as outlined in the curriculum. Students are encouraged to seek guidance or clarification from their English teacher to ensure a comprehensive and well-informed analysis of character development in ""The Merchant of Venice,"" meeting the requirements of the NSW curriculum. The submission deadline for the character commentary assessment in alignment with the NSW curriculum is in class on Wednesday of week 9 term 3. Thank you for your attention to this reminder. "

"Item 51 What is Kinetic Energy? Kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion. When an object is in motion, it has kinetic energy which is dependent on both its mass and velocity. The greater the mass of an object and the faster it is moving, the more kinetic energy it possesses. For example, a moving car has kinetic energy because it is in motion. This energy is what enables the car to overcome resistance and continue moving. Kinetic energy is a fundamental concept in physics and is an important aspect to understand when studying the motion of objects."
"Item 52 Short History of Petra, Jordan. Petra, an ancient city in present-day Jordan, is renowned for its stunning rock-cut architecture and rich history. Established by the Nabateans around the 6th century BCE, it thrived as a trading hub controlling key routes, including the famous Incense Route. During the Hellenistic and Roman periods, Petra became a significant cultural and commercial centre, showcasing unique architectural features like the Treasury (Al-Khazneh) and the Monastery (Ad Deir). However, prosperity declined in the 4th century CE with Byzantine rule and changes in trade routes, leading to its abandonment and obscurity for centuries. In the early 19th century, Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered Petra, attracting international attention. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985, Petra remains a symbol of ancient ingenuity, drawing visitors to its breathtaking tombs, temples, and facades, solidifying its status as one of the most iconic archaeological sites in the Middle East."
"Item 53 Types of Poems: Poetry comes in various forms and styles, each with its own unique characteristics. One type of poem is a narrative poem, which tells a story through verse. Narrative poems often have a plot, characters, and a setting, similar to a short story. Another type of poem is a haiku, a traditional form of Japanese poetry that consists of three lines with a 5-7-5 syllable structure. Haikus typically focus on nature and evoke a vivid image or emotion in a concise manner. Other common types of poems include lyrical poems, which express personal emotions or thoughts, and acrostic poems, where the first letter of each line spells out a word or message. There once was a cat named Pat, Who always wore a red hat. He danced and he pranced, In his hat he advanced, And everyone loved him for that! This limerick introduces the fun and playful nature of poetry to young readers, with its simple rhyme scheme and humorous content. It can engage 8-year-olds in the enjoyment of poetry and encourage them to explore more poems in different styles and forms."
"Item 54 Relationship between Zeus and Poseidon. Zeus and Poseidon are prominent figures in Greek mythology, both powerful gods ruling over different domains. Zeus is considered the king of the gods, governing the sky, lightning, and thunder, while Poseidon is the god of the sea, earthquakes, and horses. As brothers and sons of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, their relationship is complex and sometimes strained. Together with their brother Hades, they form a triumvirate of major gods. Zeus, the ruler of Mount Olympus, is depicted as a wise and just leader, maintaining order among gods and mortals. Poseidon, known for his temperamental nature, wields significant power over oceans and can unleash storms and earthquakes when angered. Despite their familial bond, Zeus and Poseidon experience conflicts. A notable example is the myth of Athens, where both gods sought to become the city's patron by offering gifts. Poseidon presented a spring of water, while Zeus offered an olive tree. Athena, the goddess of wisdom, ultimately chose Zeus's gift, resulting in Poseidon's resentment. Overall, their relationship is characterized by shared power and authority, along with rivalries that highlight the complexities of divine politics and family dynamics within the pantheon."

"Item 58 PEEL paragraph. To explain a PEEEL paragraph to 12-year-olds, you can break it down into simple terms using a relatable analogy. Here's an example of how you can explain it: Imagine a PEEEL paragraph is like building a delicious burger. The P stands for the Patty, which is the main point or topic of your paragraph. Just like the patty is the main part of the burger, your main point is the key idea you want to talk about. Next, the E is like adding some Extra toppings to your burger. These are the Examples or Evidence that support your main point. Just like toppings make the burger tastier, your examples make your point stronger and more convincing. Then, we have the E again, but this time it's for Explanation. This is where you Explain how your examples or evidence relate to your main point. It's like telling your friends why you chose those toppings for your burger. After that, we have the L for Link. This is where you Link back to your main point and wrap up your paragraph. It's like putting the top bun on your burger to hold everything together. Finally, the last E is for Ending or Extra thoughts. This is where you add any final comments, reflections, or predictions related to your main point. It's like taking that last satisfying bite of your delicious burger. By using this analogy, 12-year-olds can better understand the structure and purpose of a PEEEL paragraph in their writing."
"Item 59 A simple way to explain subtraction to a 5-year-old. Imagine you have some apples. Let’s say you have 5 apples. Now, if you give 2 apples to your friend, how many apples do you have left? Start with your 5 apples; now, take away 2 apples. You can pretend to take them away with your hands; count the apples you have left. So, if you had 5 apples and you gave away 2, you can count: 1 apple left; 2 apples left; 3 apples left. You have 3 apples left. So, we can say: 5 apples - 2 apples = 3 apples. That's what subtraction is. It’s like taking away some things from a group and seeing how many are left."
"Item 60 Sedimentary rocks are formed from tiny pieces of other rocks, minerals, and the remains of plants and animals. They begin with a process called weathering, where larger rocks break down into smaller fragments. These pieces are then carried away by wind or water in a process called erosion. When the moving wind or water slows down, it allows these pieces to settle in layers, a process known as deposition. As more layers build up over time, the weight from the layers above compresses the layers below, which is called compaction. Minerals in the water act like glue to hold the particles together, creating solid rock through cementation. There are three main types of sedimentary rocks. Clastic rocks are made from fragments of other rocks, such as sandstone. Chemical rocks form when minerals crystallise out of water, like limestone. Organic rocks are created from the remains of living things, such as coal. Sedimentary rocks are important because they often contain fossils, which provide clues about life in the past. They also contain valuable resources like coal and oil. Overall, sedimentary rocks help us learn about Earth’s history."
